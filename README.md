# Wave-Function-Collapse

This is our implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm for our advanced CS final project which uses simple principles of quantum physics to solve pattern-based constraint-satisfaction puzzles. In this case, we have created an applet that is able to produce infinite variations of any visual pattern provided by the user. <br />

Made with C++ and a little Python. Libraries used include wxWidgets for the GUI and openCV for pixel data extraction and image formatting. <br />

Enjoy!
